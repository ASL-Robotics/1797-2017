# -Insert-Robot-Name-
Code for 2017 Robot

### Installation Notes
We use some custom libraries in our code which need to be included. To make sure that you have the libraries included in the project when you build it, you do the following when you first clone the repository to your computer:

First, open up a terminal. Then change directory to the base directory of the github repository (should be called -Insert-Robot-Name- unless you renamed it). Finally, execute this series of commands:
```
cd 2017\ Robot/include/; sh setup-includes.sh
```
